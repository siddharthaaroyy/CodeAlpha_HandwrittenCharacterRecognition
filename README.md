# 📝 Handwritten Character Recognition - CodeAlpha Machine Learning Internship

This project is part of my Machine Learning internship at **CodeAlpha**.

## 📌 Task Objective

Build a model to **recognize handwritten digits (0-9)** using the MNIST dataset with **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 💻 Project Description

✔️ **Loaded MNIST dataset** (60,000 train images, 10,000 test images)  
✔️ **Preprocessed data** by normalizing pixel values  
✔️ Built a **CNN architecture** with:
- Two convolution + pooling layers
- Flatten layer
- Dense layers for classification

✔️ **Trained the model** for 5 epochs achieving **~98% test accuracy**  
✔️ **Visualized predictions** on sample test images

## 📂 Files Included

- `Handwritten_Character_Recognition.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook with code and results
